    <h1 class="TitleText">What I have done for coding</h1>
    <h5>I learnt a lot of what I know through an online coding class. It's called BYJU's future school. I attended this coding class after learning some JavaScript and HTML myself. Self learning these two languages made me realise my passion for coding and made me want to learn more. This is my github with a few repositries of what I did in the coding class. Almost all the works in my github were done with guidance from my teacher in the coding class.</h5>

    <a href="https://github.com/Fakeintelligence/Boss-Mania-V0.1">This is one of the works I did completely by myself</a>
    <h5>This is unfortunately still incomplete. To play the game you have to press 'I' on your keyboard to start. the movement keys are the 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' keys and to shoot you use the arrow keys.</h5>

    <h5>What got me into coding was actually minecraft. I started by retexturing the game files and even creating something called a datapack that slightly changes the game.</h5>
    <a href="https://github.com/Fakeintelligence/first-texturepack">this is the texturepack that I made for the game and it was the start of my adventure in anything IT related</a>
    <br></br>
    <a href="https://github.com/Fakeintelligence/wand-datapack">after i completed the texturepack I made this</a>
    <h5>these two things I created made me wonder how else could I change the game? After a bit of researching I found out that minecraft was made in JavaScript, thus leading me to start learning the language. This was the start of my coding adventure.This made me realise my passion in coding, and before I knew it, I had learned JavaScript, HTML and even a bit of Python. </h5>

    <h5>These are the certificates i have earned in my coding class</h5>
