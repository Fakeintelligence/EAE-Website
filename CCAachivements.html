    <h4>My CCA for the past few years in secondary school is NPCC.</h4> 
    <h4>In NPCC I participated actively in all activities and earned myself many badges and the rank of staff sergeant.</h4>
    <h4>One of the most notable badge I've earned is the marksmanship badge. To get this badge I had to go to HTA and attain a high score in the live firing test. Only five people in the whole batch got it</h4>
    <h4>In my CCA I also had the exco position of Head Of Logistics. I handled the logistics of everything in my CCA. For example if we were doing rifle drills that day i would be the one to prepare the rifles. </h4>
