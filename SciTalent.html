    <h2>Programmes I joined</h2>
    <h4>My school had this programme called the Science Talent Management Programme. Only a selected few from each class who wanted to join could join in Secondary 2. It was a very fulfilling experience being in this programme as I participated in many workshops related to science. </h4>
