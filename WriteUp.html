    <h5 class="largerText">Since young, I have been captivated by gadgets and their inner workings. During circuit breaker, I spent my free time delving deeper into understanding how these devices function. Given that software is an integral part of any machine, I decided to try my hand at coding. I quickly discovered that it was the perfect place for me to express my creativity and problem-solving abilities. After learning the basics, I was ready to take my passion for coding to a higher level. Thus, I enrolled in an online coding class, upgrading my skills. In the future I aim to get a job in IT.</h5>
